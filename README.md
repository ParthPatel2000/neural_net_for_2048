# Neural Net Training Project

This is a basic Python project for training a neural network on a simple dataset. It uses PyTorch for model definition and training.

## Structure
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies
- `train.py`: Main training script
- `data/`: (Optional) Place for datasets

## Setup
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. Run training:
   ```bash
   python train.py
   ```

## Notes
- You can modify `train.py` to use your own dataset or neural network architecture.
